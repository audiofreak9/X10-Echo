# X10-Echo
PHP code that can be run on a Linux PC to interface with HEYU, intended to be used with BWS System's <a href="https://github.com/bwssytems/ha-bridge">ha-bridge</a> for an Amazon Echo interface.

This repository is for my Amazon Echo X10 Home Control tutorial found here http://coreyswrite.com/tips-tricks/amazon-echo-x10-home-control/.  This file 'echo.php' provides on/off/dim X10 capability, used in my tutorial.

<ul>
  <li>Linux box with Heyu (http://www.heyu.org/) installed</li>, preferably a Raspberry Pi
  <li>Apache installed</li>
