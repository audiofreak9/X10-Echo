# X10-Echo
PHP code that can be run on a Linux PC to interface with HEYU

This repository is for my Amazon Echo X10 Home Control tutorial found here http://coreyswrite.com/tips-tricks/amazon-echo-x10-home-control/.  The 'basic' file with just on/off X10 capability, which is used in my tutorial is named echo.php.  I also have included an echo.php file which adds X10 dimming capability.

Prerequisites for this to function include: 
<ul>
  <li>Linux box with Heyu (http://www.heyu.org/) installed</li>, preferably a Raspberry Pi
  <li>Apache installed</li>
  <li>PHP installed</li>
</ul>
